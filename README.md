Script now saves user session and and have CLI session. 
I also integrated it with instabot api.
90% of it are junk code I will fix it later.

This script scrapes images from users and then repost them under your Instagram accounts with your own tags.

Demo:

## Requirements
* Python 3.6+
* Min 10-20 profiles inside instaprofiles.txt

The script does not work with new accounts. If you know how to fix, send me a message. 

## To install script with Docker:
```
git clone https://github.com/reliefs/Instagram-scraper-with-autopost.git

cd Instagram-scraper-with-autopost

Create a file called secret.txt inside that folder with the following info:
yourusername:yourpassword
Save it

change yourusername to your instagram username in file example.py line 31: InstaUsername = "yourusername"

Docker build .

Docker run [imageid]
```

First, make sure you have dlib already installed with Python bindings:

## Troubleshoot
If you are getting Illegal Instruction with face_recognition follow this guide:
https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/11#issuecomment-475482716

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'face_recognition_model_v1'

Solution: The version of dlib you have installed is too old. You need version 19.7 or newer. Upgrade dlib.
